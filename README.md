ReplacementBot is a Discord bot made to make your life easier. The Bot automatically fetches replacement from your school website and shows them right on your discord server!

## ‚ú® Feature Rich

### ‚åöÔ∏è Keep up with your replacement

ReplacementBot by the default, constantly updates one of the channels from your guild with freshest replacements. Forget about spamming with commands!

### üíª Setup Custom Source

ReplacementBot is build to support custom data sources or, as we call it, `fetchers`. Creating your very own fetcher is easy. Here, look at that fetcher:
```ts
export default class MyOwnFetcher implements ReplacementsFetcher
{
  public fetchReplacements(date: moment.Moment): Promise<ReplacementDay>
  {
    // Any of your fetching action here
    return Promise.resolve(result)
  }
}
```
Put that file in `src\fetchers` and we handle other things by ourselves
