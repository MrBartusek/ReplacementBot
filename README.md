Meet the **ReplacementBot**, a Discord bot made to make your school life easier. The Bot automatically fetches replacements from your school website and shows them right on your discord server. Automatically, every half an hour. And it even support custom fetchers. Read more about bot at: [Webiste](https://replacementbot.github.io)

## Public Instance

Unfortunately, Public Instance isn‚Äôt available right now. I would love to host one of ReplacementBot instance to make my project available to everyone. Current codebase don‚Äôt allow to use multiple replacement sources in one instance and there are not any ways to customize it by server owners. For now, that is one of highest priority long-time goals of the project.

## Running Locally

If you would like to use own bot instance to work on it locally or host it locally, or on heroku, we made a [Helpfully Guide](https://replacementbot.github.io/docs/setup)
