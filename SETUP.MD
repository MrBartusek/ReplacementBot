## üç± Setup Discord App

To run an instance of any of Discord Bots you must first create the app on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) first.<br>
There is a detailed guild which guides you through the process: [Creating a Bot Account](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html). **Be sure to copy Token from step 7, you will need it!**

## üå©Ô∏è Heroku Hosting

You can easily setup bot to work 24/7 with heroku! Be sure to enter bot token when deploying, you can get it from the step above. After setup you need to disable `web` dyno and enable `woker` dyno from **Resources** tab or, your bot will [keep crashing](https://github.com/MrBartusek/ReplacementBot/issues/60). This method require [ENV Configuration](https://github.com/MrBartusek/ReplacementBot/wiki/üîß-Configure-Bot#-environmental-variable-config) if you want to use config.
